                <h2>Developers - Destination line</h2>
                <p>We are a group of five students who study Information architecture at Malm√∂ University. This website is
                    part of a project in the systemdevelopment and project 1 course that is a part of our program. Our passion
                    is about travel as much as is it to photograph and remember the highlights. The opportunity to share
                    a full journey from start to finish in a professional way was not possible before we came up with our
                    project idea. Our goal was to develop a travel guide made by people's different experiences and finally
                    we have achieved our goal.</p>

                    presenting qualitative pictures from all around the world, take and experienced by the users. "</p>
